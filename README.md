# Gympass API

## â„¹ About the Project

This project was built in a [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br) course.

This application is designed to emulate the functionality of Wellhub (formerly Gympass), providing users with the ability to discover and check into nearby gyms seamlessly. The main goal of this app is to enhance the fitness experience by offering a convenient, intuitive platform for gym enthusiasts to manage their gym activities. Users can register, authenticate, and gain access to their check-in history and profile information directly through the app.

- CI/CD configuration

## Functional Requirements

- [x] It must be possible to register;
- [x] It must be possible to authenticate;
- [x] It must be possible to obtain the profile of a logged-in user;
- [x] It must be possible to obtain the number of check-ins performed by the logged-in user;
